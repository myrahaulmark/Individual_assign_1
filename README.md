## Instructions

You will be required to complete a series of tasks that showcase your understanding and practical application of Git and GitHub concepts. 
Follow the steps below to successfully complete the assignment:
1.	Repository Creation:
    -	Create a new local repository on your computer.
    -	Initialize the repository with an initial commit containing a README file.
2.	Remote Repository Setup:
    -	Create a new repository on your GitHub account.
    -	Link your local repository to the remote repository using the appropriate commands.
3.	Committing Changes:

    -	Include descriptive commit messages that reflect the purpose of each commit.
4.	Branch Creation:
    -	Create a new branch named "feature-branch" in your local repository.
    -	Switch to the new branch and make additional changes to the files.
    -	Commit these changes to the "feature-branch."
5.	Pull Request Initiation:
    -	Push the "feature-branch" to the remote repository.
    -	On GitHub, initiate a pull request from the "feature-branch" to the main/master branch.
    -	Include a detailed description of the changes made in the pull request.
6.	Pull Request Review:
    -	Review your pull request (or better yet, have a collaborator do it!).
7.	Merging Changes:
    -	After receiving(or giving) approval, merge the "feature-branch" into the main/master branch through the pull request on GitHub.
### Documentation:
- Collect screenshots to show the branches in your repository and that they have been successfully merged
- Include a screenshot with the closed pull request
- Include a screenshot of at least one of the files showing the commit history
### Submission: 
Submit your assignment by providing the following:
